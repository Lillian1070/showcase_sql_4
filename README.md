# [SQL] Retention Rate Ratio

This SQL practice problem is based on [Stratascratch - Retention Rate](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2053-retention-rate?code_type=3)


- Objective: Calculate the ratio of the retention rate in January 2021 to the one in December 2020 for each account ID.
- Practice Purpose: Self-learning and reinforcement of SQL data cleaning, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and window functions.
- Outline:
    - Practice (practice problem and query output)
    - Solution (step-by-step explanation)
    - Query Optimization (refinement for efficiency and readability)

[Retention Rate](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2053-retention-rate?code_type=3)


## Practice

The dataset tracks user activity. It includes information about the date of user activity, the `account_id` associated with the activity, and the `user_id` of the user performing the activity. Each row in the dataset represents a userâ€™s activity on a specific date for a particular `account_id`.


### Task 

Calculate the monthly retention rate for users for each `account_id` for December 2020 and January 2021. The retention rate is defined as the percentage of users active in a given month who have activity in any future month.


For instance, a user is considered retained for December 2020 if they have activity in December 2020 and any subsequent month (e.g., January 2021 or later). Similarly, a user is retained for January 2021 if they have activity in January 2021 and any later month (e.g., February 2021 or later).


The final output should include the `account_i`d and the ratio of the retention rate in January 2021 to the retention rate in December 2020 for each `account_id`. If there are no users retained in December 2020, the retention rate ratio should be set to 0.


- Table: `sf_events`

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| record_date   | date    |
| account_id    | varchar |
| user_id       | varchar |


### Expected Output

| account_id | retention  |
|------------|------------|
| A1         | 1          |
| A2         | 1          |
| A3         | 0          |


## Solution

*This section outlines my thought process for solving the problem.*

### Step 1: Identify the Fields Required



### Step 2a: Create a Temporary Table `T1` to xxxx



### Step 2b: Create a Temporary Table `T2` to xxxx



### Step 3: xxxxx




#### Final Syntax and Output using MySQL

##### * Syntax

```sql
WITH 
    T AS (
        SELECT 
            account_id,
            user_id, 
            (SELECT COUNT(sub.record_date) 
            FROM sf_events sub
            WHERE sub.record_date BETWEEN '2020-12-01' AND '2020-12-31') AS Dec20_act,
            (SELECT COUNT(sub.record_date) 
            FROM sf_events sub
            WHERE sub.record_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-31') AS Jan21_act,
            MAX(record_date) AS max_date
        FROM sf_events
        GROUP BY account_id, user_id
        ORDER BY account_id, user_id
    ), 
    T2 AS (
        SELECT 
            account_id,
            (CASE WHEN Dec20_act > 0 AND max_date > '2020-12-31' THEN COUNT(user_id) END) AS Dec20_ret,
            (CASE WHEN Jan21_act > 0 AND max_date > '2021-01-31' THEN COUNT(user_id) END) AS Jan21_ret
        FROM T
        GROUP BY account_id
        ORDER BY account_id
    )

SELECT 
    account_id, 
    IFNULL(Jan21_ret/Dec20_ret, 0) AS retention
FROM T2;
```

##### * Output

| account_id | retention  |
|------------|------------|
| A1         | 1          |
| A2         | 1          |
| A3         | 0          |
